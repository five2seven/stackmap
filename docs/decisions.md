# Architecture Decisions

Record durable technical choices here so future contributors understand their context and tradeoffs.

## ADR-001: React with TypeScript and Vite

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `{{DISPLAY_NAME}}` needs a lightweight, reusable frontend foundation.

**Decision:** Use React for the user interface, TypeScript for static checks, and Vite for development and production builds.

**Consequences:** The starter has a fast local workflow and a small configuration surface. Product-specific architecture remains intentionally undecided.

## ADR-002: Frontend-only starter

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The template must remain reusable across applications with different infrastructure needs.

**Decision:** Do not include a backend, authentication, payments, external APIs, or app-specific features.

**Consequences:** Applications add those capabilities only when their requirements and security model are known.

## ADR-003: Standard POC deployment foundation

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Applications created from the starter need a consistent proof-of-concept publishing convention without coupling application code to deployment providers.

**Decision:** Use GitHub for source control, Cloudflare Pages for POC hosting, Cloudflare for DNS, and Porkbun as the registrar for the `rareobjectlabs.app` umbrella domain. Each application uses `{{POC_DOMAIN}}`, which defaults to `{{REPO_NAME}}.rareobjectlabs.app`.

**Consequences:** POC URLs are predictable across applications. DNS and hosting remain external configuration concerns; this decision adds no Cloudflare-specific application code and provisions no resources.
